## Description
A program that displays various information about league of legends champions in respective roles, working with three .csv files to access this data.


This was the final project for the University of Calgary's ENDG 233 course in Fall 2024. For this project, me and my partner, David Caranay, were tasked with creating a program in Python that allowed the user to interact with .csv files in different ways, such as searching through them, requesting certain data, printing data in numpy arrays, and generating graphs using the data. 

We were required to put the functions for the .csv reading in a separate file and use it as a module rather than putting it in the main code. We were also required to place many comments to explain the program in detail to the reader.
The large amount of comments was also a requirement of the project.

Included is a video PP3.mp4, an explanation of the overall functionality of the program and how it generates plots that was also submitted for the project.

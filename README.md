# portfolio-project-3
The final project for University of Calgary's ENDG 233 class. Look at the README file for more details.

For this project, me and my partner, David Caranay, were tasked with creating a program in Python that allowed the user to interact with .csv files in different ways, such as searching through them, requesting certain data, and generating graphs using the data. 

We were required to put the functions for the .csv reading in a separate file and use it as a module rather than putting it in the main code.
